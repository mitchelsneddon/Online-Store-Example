# ETC Bawtry Online Shop Demo

My Auntie in England owns a furniture shop and asked me if I could help her build a online shop for her to sell her products. This Demo is something I quickly built using a tutorial to show her my initial ideas on how it would work. The demo is built using React and uses Hooks and fetches data from a live API.

A live demo can be found <a href="https://etc-shop.vercel.app/">here</a>
